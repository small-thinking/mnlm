# Robot Arm Controller

## Overview
The `robot_arm` package enables control of a robotic arm via external HTTP calls. It includes a simulation environment using SDF for a virtual representation of the robot arm.

## Features
- **HTTP Control**: Control the robot arm through HTTP requests.
- **Simulation**: Simulate the robot arm in a virtual environment using SDF.

## Dependencies
- ROS2 (Humble)
- Additional Python libraries (list any specific libraries needed)

## Usage
- To control the real robot arm:
- To launch the simulation:

## Simulation Details
The simulation uses SDF files for the virtual world and robot model. The simulation can be configured and launched using the provided launch files.

## Configuration
Configuration files can be found under the `config` directory. Modify these files to change the robot's parameters and behavior.
